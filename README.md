	1. Numpy - for matrix operations
	2. Python Imaging Library (PIL) - for loading and saving image
	3. Matplotlib - for viewing the processed image
	4. ArgParse - for passing arguments from the terminal

* How to run the program
	1. Installing required libraries
	`sudo pip install numpy pillow matplotlib`

	2. Running the code
	`python SPT308-CV.py --imagePath "<path-to-image>" --ptilingprop <num-edges-in-percentage>`
